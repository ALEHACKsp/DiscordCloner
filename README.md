Clone, backup, and restore discord guilds easily.
Created by Jackz#7627

**NOTE:** I have not tested this, as this was ported from a private project. It may contain unfinished code. I may work on it on a later point, It should have basic functionality (cloning servers, restoring, and backing up everything but files). I will work on it if many people want to use it.

# Features
  * Automatic backup
  * Automatic restore on guild deletion
  * Clone servers
  * Copy all roles, channels, pins, messages, files
  
### Todo
  * Save guild members' roles & restore them on join
  * Auto rejoin members on restore

# Setup

Please take a look at `sample.config.json` in the `db/` folder.

Information explaning the config.sample.json will be included later, sorry.
